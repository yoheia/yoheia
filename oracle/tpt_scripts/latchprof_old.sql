-- File name:   lhp.sql ( Latch Holder Profile )
-- Purpose:     Perform high-frequency sampling on V$LATCHHOLDER
--				and present a profile of latches held by sessions
--
-- Author:      Tanel Poder
-- Copyright:   (c) http://www.tanelpoder.com
--              
-- Usage:       @latchprof <what> <sid> <latch name> <#samples>
-- 	        	@latchprof sid,name 350 library 100000
--	        	@latchprof name % % 1000000
-- Other:
--				The sampling relies on NESTED LOOP join method and having
--				V$LATCHHOLDER as the inner (probed) table. Note that on 9i
--				you may need to run this script as SYS as it looks like otherwise
--				the global USE_NL hint is not propagated down to X$ base tables
--
--				If sampling always reports a single latch event even though 
--				many different events (or parameter values) are expected then 
--				the execution plan used is not right.
--
--				If you want to drill down to latch child level, uncomment the
--				l.laddr fields from select and group by list.
--				Then you can use la.sql (V$LATCH_PARENT/V$LATCH_CHILDREN) to
--				map the latch address back to latch child#
