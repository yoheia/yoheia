-- File name:   exafriendly.sql (report non-exadata-friendly SQL and their stats)
--
-- Purpose:     This script is a collection of queries against ASH, which will
--              report and drill down into workloads which don't use Exadata smart
--              scanning and are doing buffered full table scans or random single 
--              block reads instead. It uses the 11g new ASH columns
--              (SQL_PLAN_OPERATION, SQL_PLAN_OPTIONS) which give SQL plan line
--              level activity breakdown.
--
--              Note that this script is not a single SQL performance diagnosis tool,
--              for looking into a single SQL, use the SQL Monitoring report. This 
--              exafriendly.sql script is aimed for giving you a high-level
--              bird's-eye view of "exadata-friendiness" of your workloads, so you'd 
--              detect systemic problems and drill down where needed.
--
-- Usage:       @exafriendly.sql <ash_data_source>
--
-- Examples:    @exafriendly.sql gv$active_session_history
--                       
--              @exafriendly.sql "dba_hist_active_sess_history WHERE snap_time > SYSDATE-1"

-- 
--
-- Other:       I strongly recommend you to read through the script to understand
--              what it's doing and how the drilldown happens. You likely need
--              to customize things (or at least adjust filters) when you diagnose
--              stuff in your environment.
